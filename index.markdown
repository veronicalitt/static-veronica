Welcome to my little website, which uses the principles and practices of minimal computing to share my work as an English professor, digital scholar, letterpress printer, and public-facing writer.

Learn more about me on the About page and explore different aspects of my work in my Portfolio.

Please enjoy my branding, i.e./ images of terrible cats from the eighteenth century.
