# Digital Scholarship

## Podcasting

**Podcasting Workshops and Asynchronous Module**

I regularly lead workshops on podcasting at post-secondary institutions in Canada. Over several sessions, I co-developed an asynchronous learning module on the subject. [This guide](https://learn.scds.ca/podcasting/) walks new podcasters through a six-step process for developing, scripting, recording, editing, and sharing their work. While teaching McMaster's introductory Digital Humanities class in 2023, this module also supported the class as we co-developed The Cyber Cinema Podcast. 


**Yesterday's News**

At my first job outside of the academy, I ran and co-hosted a successful history podcast called Yesterday's News. With no marketing budget, we amassed 2000+ listeners per episode in under a month. [Listen to the podcast.](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/yesterdays-news/id1563444201)

## Websites and Digital Exhibits

**DS Tutorials**

When I worked as the Sherman Centre's Digital Scholarship Coordinator, I moved away from proprietary website builders like Wordpress and embraced open source coding and minimal computing. Part of my work involved learning to use GitHub and developing tutorial sites on software like Twine Games, a hypertext game design platform. [Browse the Twine module here.](https://learn.scds.ca/dmds22-23/Twine.html) One of my key projects was developing the "Online Learning Catalogue" which corralled all of the Centre's 100+ digital tutorials into a [searchable database](https://scds.ca/searchable-online-learning/). 

**Public-Facing Eighteenth-Century Work**

Some of my first experiments with DH and DS involved using websites as a no-barrier tool to bring my work to the public. My first project was a digital exhibit of my Book History practicum project on [popular books about women at mid-century](https://feminocentricnarratives.wordpress.com/). The second was an [interview-based blog](https://cosmopolitanisms.wordpress.com/) for the 2017 Canadian Society of Eighteenth-Century Studies conference. This site paired each interview with a relevant holding at the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library. 

## Teaching and Training

**Teaching** 

In 2023, I designed a new iteration of McMaster University's introductory Digital Scholarship course. My class introduced 33 students to the multi-faceted and energetic field of Digital Scholarship through two key questions. First, how does technology change the way we see classic works of literature? Second,
how does scholarly analysis change the way we see technology? We considered both queries through close analysis of Frankenstein (1818) by Mary Shelley. Students learned to use the text analysis platform Voyant, Google Maps' digital mapping tool, podcasting, and Twine games. 

**Training**

I've learned about the Text Encoding Inititative, artificial intelligence, and Indigenous data sovereignty through workshops and modules like DHS@Guelph, DHSI East, and OCAP. I also provide DS training opportunities to other scholars, specifically working on McMaster's SSHRC-funded RDM Community Data Toolkits event and Cape Breton University's SSHRC-funded work on culture bearers, where I provide podcast support.
