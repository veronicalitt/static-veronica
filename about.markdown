Hi! I’m Veronica Litt. I’m an English professor, writer, reader, digital jack-of-all-trades, and amateur letterpress printer from Hamilton, Ontario. I’ve worked as a website writer and Digital Scholarship Coordinator and currently am an Assistant Professor of English at Cape Breton University. I teach first-year English and develop courses on sex and gender in literature and 18th-century literature, among other things (myths and modern adaptations! the weird idea of home in Canada! digital riffs on the Frankenstein story!).

My research focuses on mass reading experiences of the mid-eighteenth century. I’m currently using institutional funding to develop a database of eighteenth-century readers and drafting a book proposal on how popular novels intersected with abolition and proto-feminism. I’ve been published in peer-reviewed journals like Book History,Persuasions Online, and Women’s Writing, among others.

As a public-facing writer, I’ve authored several articles and a short book on the iconic teen film _Clueless_ (ECW, 2025). I’m in the early stages of my next project: a short book on villains.

As a digital scholar, I focus on academic-adjacent podcasting, digital editions, and hypertext games, though I dabble in computational text analysis and minimal computing. My interests in this field are expansive so I recommend viewing my various projects in my Digital Scholarship Portfolio to get a sense of my enthusiastic novice approach to DS work.

Oh, and I received my PhD from the University of Toronto’s English and Book History programs in 2022. That’s where I fell in love with letterpress printing and eighteenth-century novels.
