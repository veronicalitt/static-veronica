## About Me

Hi! I’m Veronica Litt. I’m an English professor, writer, reader, digital jack-of-all-trades, and amateur letterpress printer from Hamilton, Ontario. I’ve worked as a website writer and Digital Scholarship Coordinator and currently am an Assistant Professor of English at Cape Breton University.

I teach first-year English and develop courses on 18th-century novels and gender in literature, among other things (myths and modern adaptations! the weird idea of home in Canada! digital riffs on the _Frankenstein_ story!).

My research focuses on mass reading experiences of the mid-eighteenth century. I explored this field in my doctoral work at the University of Toronto's English and Book History programs. I'm currently using institutional funding to develop a database of eighteenth-century readers and drafting a book proposal on how popular novels intersected with abolition and proto-feminism. I’ve been published in peer-reviewed journals like _Book History_,_Persuasions Online_, and _Women’s Writing_, among others.

As a public-facing writer, I’ve authored several articles and a short book on the iconic teen film _Clueless_ (ECW, 2025). I’m in the early stages of my next project: a short book on villains.

In my digital work, I focus on academic-adjacent podcasting, digital editions, and hypertext games, though I dabble in computational text analysis and minimal computing. I am an enthusiastic novice and always interested in learning about new tools and approaches!
